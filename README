The project was developed using Scala 2.12 and Spark (Core and SQL) 2.4.4, with the Maven Dependency Manager.

After unzip the project, open either IntelliJ IDEA or Eclipse and import the project folder as a Maven Project
(correct version of dependencies should appear in pom.xml file). Then, click build project, then you can run each exercise.
(specify the correct Module if needed)

The project is devided into 5 programs, each representing one of the five exercises. To run one exercise, either:
(1) open the exercise file you wish to run, right click anywhere in the .scala file page, and click "Run Exercise N"
    or
(2) right-click in the project tree, on the file you wish to run, and click "Run".

The output files appear in the /output folder.


ToDo:
- Set default values in tuples that have null values, when requires (ex: appear in the table 0.0 instead of null/NaN)
- Saving the dataframe into a .csv/parquet file created a folder for it automatically, where the folder always gets the name of the supposed
file, and the file has a auto-generated name. Could only change it to the intended name manually, not automatically. 
- Show Prices in € (make the conversion from $ to €).
- In Exercise 5, figure a way to group the Genres column and join it with the AvgPolarity + AvgRating columns.
